## **How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?**

Our Github [project boards](https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretNetwork/projects?type=beta) track enhancement suggestions through [Github Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues).

* **Include screenshots** that help you demonstrate the steps or point out the relevant part of the affected Secret Network
* **Explain why this enhancement would be helpful to** most Secret Network users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a community project.

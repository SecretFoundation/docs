# Query Pool

A staking `Pool` defines the dynamic parameters of the current state. You can query them with the following command:

```
secretcli q staking pool
```

With the `pool` command you will get the values for:

* Not-bonded and bonded tokens
* Token supply
* Current annual inflation and the block in which the last inflation was processed
* Last recorded bonded shares

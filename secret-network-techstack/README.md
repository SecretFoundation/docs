# Secret Network Techstack

Secret Network is built with the Cosmos SDK and the Tendermint consensus engine. Secret Network provides a platform for scalable, private permissionless smart contracts which can connect to the interchain.&#x20;

Secret Network leverages novel key management techniques, encryption schemes, and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology to bring encrypted input, output, and state to the blockchain.

The decentralized network of computers that host Secret Network come to a consensus (delegated Proof-of-Stake — Byzantine Fault Tolerance) without ever obtaining access to the data they process. Users can use “viewing keys” to view their sensitive data or enable third parties to do the same.

Secret brings privacy to the Interchain by leveraging CosmWasm IBC compatible smart contracts and IBC native token bridging.\

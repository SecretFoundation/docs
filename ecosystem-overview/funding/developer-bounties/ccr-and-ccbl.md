# CCR \[On-hold]

### Community code repositories (CCR)

The community code repositories are a small bounty framework where developers can take up tasks taking up to 20-30 hours to complete and thereby create an open source code library to be used by any other developer on the network.\
\
The CCR concept is budgeted for by the Secret Network development Committee and open projects can be found in the [Github repository](https://github.com/SecretNetwork/secret-network-community-code-repositories). Before taking on a task the Development committee leads will have a quick conversation with you so they can guide you in the project.\
\
Upon completion the code for the created tool is open sourced and the developer is paid the agreed upon bounty of up to $ 2,500 USD.\
\
To contribute please reference the [Contributing.md](https://github.com/SecretNetwork/secret-network-community-code-repositories/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the CCR repository.

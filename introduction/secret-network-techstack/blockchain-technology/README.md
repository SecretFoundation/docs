# Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology is a complex base layer allowing open-source protocols and decentralized applications to be built on top of it. Secret is a sovereign layer 1 of the Cosmos ecosystem built with the Cosmos SDK.

This section will walk you through the Secret technology stack to get a better understanding of what’s under the hood of the privacy hub for Web3. This "Blockchain technology" section starts with a quick grasp of what the different blockchain layers are and an explanation of the Cosmos stack&#x20;

In this section we will explain in depth the components of the blockchain stack:

* [Cosmos introduction](cosmos-basics.md)
* [Tendermint Consensus](tendermint.md)
* [Cosmos SDK](cosmos-sdk.md)
* [Inter-Blokchain Communication (IBC)](ibc.md)
* [CosmWasm Smart contracts](cosmwasm.md)

**The Cosmos part of the Secret Techstack is also covered Part 1 and Part 2 of the Secret Network techstack video series.**
